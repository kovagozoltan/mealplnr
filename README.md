# MealPlnr

MealPlnr - weekly meal plan and shopping list webapp.

## Motivation

Because of the busy lives we live in our household, my friend was getting tired of nearly daily running to the shop and wasting time wondering what to eat. Not only did that take up time, we spent more money on food (buying non essentials) and starting to live unhealthy, due to eating more convenient food and the extra rubbish we bought each timewe entered the shop. The meal planner was my solution. Once a week we sit together as a family and decide on what to eat. Each meal can be saved for later use. To each meal, a list of ingredients can be added and selected to go into the shoppinglist. The plan can be shared with another user via an invitation system.
